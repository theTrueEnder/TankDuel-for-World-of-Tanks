# TankDuel for World of Tanks Blitz!
TankDuel is a text-based 1v1 duel simulator for WOTB! You simply input the statistics of the duelling vehicles, and the simulator does the rest! The simulator also allows for the Adrenaline consumable use in a duel. 

## - How to use:
Near the beginning of the code (usually in the first 10-20 lines), there's an area for you to enter the stats of the duelling tanks.

An easy way to obtain the information of some tanks is through https://blitzhangar.com. Once it's all in, just run the code! The results will display in your IDE console. 

## - Future features:
- Distance and Shell Velocity features
- Min/Max rolls for shell damage
- Graphical HP bar
